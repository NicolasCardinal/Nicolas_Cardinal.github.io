As a data scientist passionate about artificial intelligence, I transform data into innovative solutions to inform decision-making.

With strong skills in data science and machine learning, I master the entire analytical process, from data extraction to communicating results.

- Data Analysis: Expertise in data extraction, cleaning, preprocessing, and descriptive analysis. Careful selection of key indicators to meet strategic needs.

- Machine Learning: Skills in predictive modeling, time series analysis, classification, dimension reduction, and more.

- Data Visualization: Development of interactive dashboards with R-Shiny and creation of impactful visualizations with ggplot2.

- Communication of Results: Clear synthesis of analyses, writing of reports, and presentation of results for informed decision-making.

Driven by a constant curiosity, I am always seeking new knowledge to improve my skills in data science, both in machine learning and deep learning.
